pios, ‘ fond,' ‘wifely'. See Vocabulary.

390. plena eet promissi gratia vestri, ‘the kindness of your
promised assistance is (already) complete.’ Peleus declares him-
self amply satisfied with the generous offer already made (287) and

‘gnoggh thytr htrtlpbaldes ready-prohered aid

But though the first person plural is often used for the singular, vos
and vester are never=fu and tuus. Since, therefore, vestri must

(cf. tenemus, 284), than to 382, 3. Ι 1 ¹ ‚

emphasis falls on nova—‘ no fresh monsters’. This is, 1 thmk,

portent.' Perhaps movere should be read.

392. numen pelagi: the Nereid, Psamatbe.

393. aros summe, ‘on the erest of the hill!

396. villos: 4n.

398. caeruleam. This, like other epithets applied to the sea

the deities of that element, 158 n.

399. neo, ‘but not?

400. hano=ltutien ‘for this sin!

401. sedenim: 1311. ’

403. leoeree: in sense with cervice, a ‘transferred’ epithet.

404. marmore. The more usual construction isin with accus, but

the ablative is occasionally found, though the use is not very fully
