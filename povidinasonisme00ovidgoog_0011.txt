oi him, undertaking some ol the minor judicial offices comprised
under the title ol Vigintivirate— Board ol Twenty-and serving as
'l'riumvr'r (Cupilulr's or Morretarlis- he does not say which) and as
Decemvir lr'tibus iudicandis, in addition to acting as a member os
the Centurrrvirr', and occasionally as an arbitrator in civil cases.
The discharge os these lesser magistracies was regarded as qualil ’-
ing the political aspirant lor the higher offices ol state, and the
poet’s next step would naturally have been the quaestorship, which
carried with it a seat in the Senate But at this point, moved
either by distaste lor politics and his natural indolence, or a distrust
ol his own ability and physical powers, he definitely relinquished his
political ambitions. ln his own words,¹ ‘the broad stripe of my
tunic was narrowed,’ i.e. he waived the right to wear the lalus
clavus, which indicated senatorial rank, and remained content with
his hereditary status as a plain eques.

For the next thirtyyears helived at Romeincomiort on the compe-
tence provided by his parents. There his brilliant gisls and amiable
disposition made him a host ol friends, and he soon became the
favourite poetol the refined society ol the Imperial city, in its lighter,
not to say laxer, moods. Little is recorded ol him during this
period, but the evidence ol his writings leads us to inser that he was
leading the seli-indulgent lite ot' a ‘man about town ’. Yet Ovid
was not a Horace Walpole, meanly uniting an ambition sor literary
glory withan affected contempt lor men ol letters. He maintained
a close intimacy with many ol the poets who gathered in the salons
ol Maecenas (whom, however, he does not name), Messalla, and
Fabius Maximus. Vergil, he tells us in a phrase which has become
proverbial, he had ‘only seen'3 Tibullus died young, and Ovid was
never acquainted with him; but he commemorated his sellow-poet
in one of the finest of his elegies ;² his ears had been ‘enchanted
by the melodious Horace’; Propertius was his sworn·cornpaniou
(sodalis); Ponticus, Macer, Bassus, and a number ol others who
are only names to us, his friends.

He was thrice married; two ol these unions had only ashort dura·
tion and were ended by divorce. For his third wile he seems to have
had a sincere affection. But domesticity was not one ol his virtues,
