METAMORPHOSES xr. 2-7

lt has also a secondary sense, ‘obedient' Compare hlilton's use ol
obsequious‚ P. L. vi. 781 ‘th' uprooted hills . . . heard his voice and
went obsequious’; ducr't combines the ideas ol ‘ lead' and ‘charm ’.
3. nurus Oloonum, ‘the C iconian dames! sertrus is frequently
synonymous with ‘women ¹, when it is followed by a genitive, as here,
or by an adjective (ii. 366 ‘ nuribus gestanda Latinis’). See the dis-
cussion ol tlte use ol nunus by Prol. W. R. Hardie, in the Classical
Review, vol. xviii, p. 158. So reratres, 69. The plurals of nurus
and rnaler are metrically more convenient than that ol sectatrici,
which dactylic verse will not admit. For the same reason ¹the epic
poets have to lind equivalents lorsillvg' such as nali, r'rlvlnes, &a
Cleonum. Poetical lor ‘Thracian ’. The Cicones were a
Thracian tribe which dwelt near Mt. lsmarus
3. lymphata, ‘lrenzied,' with the Bacchic enthusiasm. The
origin ol this curious word is obscure. Probably Nympho and
&supha were connected or confused in popular etymology, so
that the Greek vvpddlsyuroe-Nymph possessed, benymphed-came
to be rendered in Latin by hisimbertus. For the belief that the
N ymphs possessed the power of inspiring madness and delirium,
see Heroides, iv. 49-50, where Phaedra likens hersell in her lits ol

lrenzy to

‘quas semideae Dryades Faunique bicornes
numine contactas attonuere suo '.

Similar formations are panic, lunatio, and (in the comedians)
cerritus and laniatus.

4. pectore. This is an instance ol the common poetical con·
struction ol the ‘retained accusative ⁹, by which the objective accus.
depends directly on a passive verb, as tl the verb were still active.
lt isan imitation of the Greek accus. aster the past part. of passive
and middle verbs. Some ol the instances approximate to and run
into the accus. ol ‘part affected' or ⁴ reference ², e. g. saucius caput.
So pectora here might be taken under either head, bnt since it is
governed by a past participle, it is more conformable to the usage
ol the Latin poets to regard it as a ‘retained accusative ‘. Trans.
‘ their hreasts covered ¹.

5. sociantem. Milton, L'Allegro, ‘Soft Lydian airs, married to
immortal verse ’. Hor. Odes, iv. 9.4‘verba loquor socianda chordis'.

6. laetato crine per auras. A characteristic pose ol the
Bacchantes, as represented in ancient art. Cl. Cat. Attis 23 ‘ubi

where Tyrrell quotes Sen. Troades, 473 ‘Cervice lusam dissipans
iacta comam.

7. nostri contemptor. Cs. x. 79 and Verg. Georg. iv. 516
‘ Nulla Venus, non ulli animum flexere hymenaei '‚ and 520 ‘spretae
