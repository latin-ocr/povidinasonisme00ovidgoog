LIFE AND WORKS OF OVlD ix

incursione of the Scythians against the town wheucver the frozen
Danube gave them passage, and in consequence a tardy novitiate in
warfare for the poet; the poisoned artows of these foemen dropping
in the main ways of the town. All these and other disagreeables,
superadded to his great 3ηά enduring regret for Rome, were far
from being counterbalanced by the hospitable reception which the
Tomitans accorded to the distinguished sojoumer in their midst.

Ovid never ceased to petition for pardon, but his protestations of
innocente 3ηά abject pleas for the remission, or at least the allevia-
tion, of his sentence, were unheeded by Augustus, and Tiberius, his
