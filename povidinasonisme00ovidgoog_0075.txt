illustrated in the lexicons. Cf. below 7423 iv. 396 ‘quae modo
tila suerunt, palmite mutantur'; ix. 81 ‘tauro mutatus membra
rebell0'; xii. 34 ‘supposita fertur mutasse Mycenida cerva’. This
abl. isdlkin to, but not identical with, that which Horace affecte,
e.g.0 r, iii. 1. 47:

‘cur valle permutem Sabina
divitias operosiores?’

Stories ol this kind were suggested by the resemblance, real or

lancied, of a rock, stone, or other natural object to the animal or

object in question, cl. xii. 23 ‘fit lapis et servat serpentis imagine

saxum'; and Homer’s story ol the petrifaction of the Phaeacian

ship (od. xiii. 156). Antoninus Liberalis asserts that this ‘Wolf

Stone' was long to be seen on the borders ol locris and Phocis.
mutavit: sc. Psamatbe.

According to the account more generally received, Peleus sougbt
refuge in his exile, not with Ceyx, but with Eurytion, king ol
Phthia, and it was for the bloodguiltiness incurred when he by
mishap transfixed his host with an arrow during the hunting os the
Calydonian boar, that he was shriven by Acastus. ll the interpre-

purgamine: for plural, 8n. Whoever was guilty ol a serious
transgression was not allowed to take part in the worship ol the
gods until he had been shriven by an innocent man. For the
nature of this purification see vii. 261 ‘terque senem flamma, ter
aqua, ter sulfure lustrat ².

ln this story, as in the preceding, Ovid follows Nicander.

pathetic os all the stories, is a genuine sea-idyll. Though. as so
