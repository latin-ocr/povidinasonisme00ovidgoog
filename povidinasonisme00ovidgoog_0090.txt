METAMORPHOSES XI. 744-756

744. ooeunt, ‘mate'

748. praestatque, dcc, ‘and smooths the main lor his daughter's
children.' Alcyone was daughter ol Aeolus, 431. For praestare in
the sense ol ‘warrant favourable' cl. Her. xv. 213 Venus orta
mari mare praestat amanti '.

[749-795. One os tlte spectatam of tais sad scene is rrrooed lo tell
os a similar transformatam. Aesacus, scm of Priam by Alexr'rhae,
was rnamoured os the nymph Hesperie. When lte pursued her, slre
fied away, but in ker ,argit wtrs br'tten by a snake and died. Her
wooer, ἐκ a srenzy cy remorsa, cast himself into tlte sea from a roci·

hard by, but in the air was cheringe! by Tethys r'nto a ‘diver ’.]

By means ol this episode the poet makes the transition to the
tale of Troy and the Roman legends which form its natural sequel.

749. senior = senex, 157 n.

stete: accus. ol ‘space traversed ’, like ‘currere aequor,' dic.

751. si fors tulit: trans. simply ‘perchance’. ferre is osten
used intransitively to express tendency, e. g. ‘mea lert opinio,' ‘si
occasio tulerit ’.

752. gerentem = not much more than ‘having, with ¹.

753. n, ‘in respect ol', a sonrewhat difficult use ol the prep.
ln such expressions in expresses the idea ol motion to some end.
Such motion may be actual (‘ crescere in spatium ¹) or metaphorical,
as here and in x 538 ‘celsum in cornua cervum ’.

guttura: 8n.

755. huius orlgo, ‘the founders of his line’ This personal
nse of the word occurs first in Vergil. Cf. Aen. xii. 166 ‘pater
Aeneas, Romanae stirpis origo ⁹, imitated by Tacitus, Amr. iv. 9
;or}go lullae gentis Aeneas ’. Milton (ol Adam), P. L. ii. 37 5 ‘our
mmm&

756. iovi: 297 n. For this genealogy cl. Hom. Il. xx. 215, where
Aeneas, in tracing his own descent from Assaracus, says, ‘l'irst
Zetis begat Dardanus, and he built Dardania (Troy). Then
Dardanus begat ason Erichthonius, and Erichthonius begat Tros
to be lord over the Trojans, and to Tros three noble sons were
born, llus and Assaracus, and godlike Ganymedes, who became
the most beautiful of mortal men. th the gods caught up to be
cupbearer to Zeus. Then llus again begat a son, noble Laomedon,
anddlaomedon begat Tithonus and Pn'am. And Priam begat the
goo yHector.'

lt will be seen that Assaracus and Ganymede are out ol the
line oi direct descent, and some editors think that 756 is an
interpolation. Pelle excludes it, and reads llus lor huius in 755,
thus making the pedigree strictlya descent from father to son. But
agarrulous narrator tends naturally to introduce the great names
ol Trojan myth, whether relevant or not to the main pointel the

genealogy.
