METAMORPHOSES XI. 115-126

115μ admovit: ‘frequentative‘ or ‘iterative’ perfect oi present
time, as in¹ the best prose. laverat, 116, contigerat, 122, and
miscuerat, 125, arethe corresponding pluperfects os past time.
R. 1717, Bradley, ξ 434.

videntur, ‘are seen!

116. Here, as in 121, the ille is redundant.

117. patmussimple abl of separation, where prose would
τεῳῗαῗιὲοἴὲῗοςὲιὲῑῗίἷίῗιῗξείοτεηὰε to the golden shower, in which

. form Jupiter obtained admission to Danae, confined by her

father, Acrisius, king ol Argos, in an inaccessible castle.
iv. 611 ‘Persea quem pluvio Danae conceperat auro'. William
Mortis hasa beautiful version of the story m ‘The Doom ol King
Acrisius ’.

123. eonvellere, ‘ chew!
h. &ratu i.‘ e. he tried to evade the transformation by not using

rs s.

¹²4· proruebat here = tegebat, ‘spread over’, as in ix. 3 5 3 ‘ lentus
prennt inguina cortex‘.

125. auctorem muneris. The Latin poets osten substitute l'or the
firoduct or province os a god the name or description of the god

imseli. So Mars stands for war, Ceres (112) sor corn, breed, Vul-
canus lor stre, and here ‘auctorem ¹muneris'=Bacchus=wine. The
convention is burlesqucd by Juvenal, vii. 24, 25:

‘ uae
componis dona Veneris, Telesine, mirlritossv

i.e. commit your scribblings to the flames, my poor hard.

The ‘conceit' here is artificial in the extreme, but quite typical
ol Ovid. There is a similar frigidity inxii.614 ‘armarat deus idem,
idemque cremarat’ (of Achilles, who had been armed by Neptune,
and was burnt on the funeral p re). See 621 n. auctor here=
‘giver’. See Vocabulary. Ovi much affects the use of auctor
withha genligive, such phrases serving as a concise substitute lor
are trvec use.

125—6. miscuerat.. ‚viderem The first sentence, though Ἴ

expressed independently (for rhetorical liveliness), is in sense subor-
dinate to the second. Cl. Juv. iii. 100:

‘rides‚ maiore cachinno
concutitur: flet, si lacrimas conspexit amici‚‘

and Hor. Sat. i. 1. 45, i. 3. 15. English, in the same way, some-
times has parataxis (co-ordination) oi clauses instead ol hypotaxis
gsgtvlreorsdigrgtion). Translate: ‘Did he mix . . .? you might
