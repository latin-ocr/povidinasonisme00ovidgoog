METAMORPHOSES XI. 26-39

matutine. Time is often expressed by an adjective in Latin
and Greek where English would have an adverb.
periturus, ‘doomed’
28. non haee ln munere. foetos, ‘fashioned for far different
service than this’
non haeo = alia by litotes or meiosis, i.e. the effective use of
alnegativgekinstead of an affirmative, form of expression. Cf. Verg.
en. ιν. 4 :
‘ensemque recludit
, Dardanium, non hos quaesitum munus in usus’.

Aen. xi. 45:

‘non haec Evandro de te promissa parenti
discedens dederam'

and Hor. Odes, i. 15. 32.

·29. arbore: abl. of separation, with direptos.
30. pers = alii, hence torquente
neu desint. The irregular sequence of the present subjunc-
tiveis due to the fact that tbe clause expresses the purpose not of
the action sathagebant, but of the mention ol the action (⁶ that you may
not suppose that ’). So ne dicam (‘ not to say ') is used without any
reference to the tense of the principal sentence. Cf. viii. 579:

‘quoque minus spretae factum mirere Dianae,
Naides hae fuerant!

The instance before us is less easy, since no verb of thinking,
dcc, is inserted to modify the irregularity of the sequence.

31. presso, ‘ down-driven!

32. fructum : ie. the future harvest.

35. arma. The original meaning of arina (etym. ar-fit to,fasten)
is fitting, instrument, implement. Verg. Georg. i. 160 ‘dicendum et
quae sint duris agrestibus arma'3 and Aen. ι. 177, where Cerealia
arvenis Vergilian for ‘handmill ⁹. lt is often used of the tackling
of a ship 513. From its meaning ‘fit to' it easily comesto mean
what is fastened to one as a protection, i. e. defensive armour as
opposed to tela—weapons of offence, 382.

36. seruuleque. ln the second or fifth foot of the line que in
‘arsis' may be lengthened, but only before a double consonant or its
equivalent, and when another que immediately succeeds. lt is
imitated from the Homeric lengthening of τε. The present example
of a long que before the single consonant r is most unusual, but we
may suppose that this also is an imitation of Greek prosody, where
the same peculiarity occurs.

37. ferae: adjective ; ‘the furious troop’

38. feta, ‘death,' ‘murden’ Ovid is the first to use the word of
adolent death, destruction.

39. illo tempore: tempus is often used in Latin ·(like καιρός
