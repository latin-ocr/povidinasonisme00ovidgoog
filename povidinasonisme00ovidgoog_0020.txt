cases a marked independence ol treatment. Only on these terms,
indeed, could the ear of his public bave been won at all. The
same consideration doubtless explains why Ovid, with the instinct

of the reconteur, passes rapidly over themes which schoolmaster
and poetaster, Orbilius and Bavius and Maevius between them,
had already done to death.¹

Two points in the conduct of his subject may be taken to illustrate
Ovid’s art. (1) The transitions from one legend to another, (2) the
descriptions of the transformations.

(ι) By means of the skilful transitions, one episode after another is
woven into the texture of the work. Their introduction is justified in
various ways3 by the general similarity of the tale to be related to
the preceding story ; by the similarity of the transfonnation, or the
identity of scene3 or the story belongs to the same god or man;
hymns are sung, as by Orpheus, or songs‚ as by the Minyeides at their
looms, celebrating transformations; a person is mentioned as absent
from a scene or a company, and this circumstance is explained in
afresh story. Very rarely is there anything like a break in the story,²
although the connexion is occasionally strained and far-fetched,aud
once, at least, Ovid does violence to geography in order to secure
a transition³

(2) ln describing the transformations, the poet’s skill is shown in
¹ the gradual adaptation of the human being, part by part, to the
being or thing which results from the change. Nothing in the
poem more fully justifies Macaulay's praise that ‘ in ingenuity and
the art of doing difficult things in expression and versification as il
they were the easiest in the world, Ovid is incomparable '. Some
of the forms of metamorphosis, eg. that into a plant or tree, occur
frequently, and afford the poet an opportunity of displaying his
never-failing variety. lle is no less successful with that which has
no parts—stone and water3 and we often find further refinements
like ii. 672 (of Ocyrrhoe, changed into a mare),

194-220, where the poet gives only the marn pomts of the story. He is
evidently eager to proceed to the story of Peleus. llence, too, the slight
