conventional attitude. [Professor Slater takes status ipse differently.
‘His stance aloru (before he struck a note) bewrayed a master':
this certainly has more point]

171. citharae submittere omnes: lit. to lower his reeds
before the lute. K. ‘The vanquished pipe confess the victor lyre.'
For the expression cf. Livy ii. 7 ‘submissrs fascibus ’.

174. neo =‘but not '.

176. trahit in spatium, ‘draws out lengthwise.’ Cf. ii. 197
‘(88corpius) porrigit in spatium signorum membra duorum'3 vii.

in spatiumque fugit, sed decipit ora sequentis

an abl. of description, ‘his brows with their unsightly disfigure·

pudorem ’l is the fact that the deformity lies in the aures, not io
the tempora. This difficulty might be removed by reading with
two MSS. ‘lile quidem celat, turpique onerata pudore tempora.'
Cf. Fast. iv. 219 ‘At cur turrifera caput est onerata coronai'
Professor Slater thinks that turpimay conceal an objective genitive,
but that if the reading is sound it must be regarded as either a
stock epithet, ‘humiliating’ &cor ‘ transferred' from Midas to his
feelings. In the latter case the words would mean practically ‘in
shame athis disfigurernent’. Merkel brackets ‘turpique. .. temptat ’.
