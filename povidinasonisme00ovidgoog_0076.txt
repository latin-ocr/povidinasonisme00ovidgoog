METAMORPHOSES 'XL 411-a25

fratrem seoutis= ⁴ prodigia fratris secutis!v 1⁴For the construc-
tion, 155 n.; the reference is to the episode of the destroying wolf
and its petrification‚ 346409. .

Itis strange that the editors do not remark the harshness and
obscurity of the expression here. May not ‘fratrem secutis' in
the sense ol ‘prodigies attendant on his brother’ be a gloss on
‘fratris sui prodigiis ', which has ousted the latter halt ol 410.
[Perhaps the reading should be ‘fratris questu fratremque secutis ’.
‘fratris questu’=his brother’s lament, plaint. Cl. 331 ‘natam
delamentatur ademptam ¹. D.A.S.]

The order is ‘interea Ceyx, turbatus anxia pectora prodigiis et
fratris sui et fratrem secutis, parat ’.

pectora: 4n„ ,

412. oblenimina. ¹Ovid has as a decided liking lor these¹ neuters
ending in -men, as Chaucer for words ending in -cioun τ purgamen
409, imitamen 626, eaedicamen, and moderamen occur only in the
Metamorphoses.

The MSS. reading oblectamina does not lurnish the required
antithesis to turbatus pectora; oblenimiaa is Korn's conjecture.

413. nam introduces a clause explaining why Ceyx, in order to
consult Apollo, was compelled to seek his shrine at Claros overseas,
instead of visiting the world-famous oracle at Delphi, which was
not lar distant from Trachin, 339 n. ’

415. consilli: lor the gen. cf. vi. 268 ‘tam subitae matrem certam
fecere ruinae’. Classical prose would have ‘certamem facit de
consile'o’ (consilii also, but not in Caesar). This genitive is an exten·
sion ol the use alter adjectives of knowledge and ignorance. ’

417. buxo simillimus. For construction, 155n. The pale·
nessol the yellow boxleai was proverbial. See note on palluit, 110.

419. ter, ‘again and again,’ ol an indefinite number ol times.
So ‘terque quaterque' and other combinatione.

422. eura mei: attracted into the relative clause.

423. seourus,‘untroubled,'‘unconcerned’. Securusconlormably
to its derivation (se = sine ÷ cura) implies not sasety but a man’s
own sense os safety, whether this is well or ill grounded. This,
too, was the primary signification ol the English derivative. Shake·
speare, Re'cle. Il, 11. i:

‘We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And yet we strike not, but securely perish’

But the subjective sense tended to pass into the objective, and thus
the word became, to the impoverishment ol the language, a mere
synonym lor ‘ sale ’. Trench, Select Glossary.

425. puto: ironically, as often when parenthetical. at pato
often introduces objections which the speaker then proceeds to
refute. ln this case the objection is purely imaginary.

425. tantum: the adverb.
