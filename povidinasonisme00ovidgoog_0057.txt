METAMORPHOSES XI. roa-114

from the gift ⁹, and we arrive at much the same meaning by a
somewhat different way. D.A.S.]

¹03· fulvum: a stoclr epithet‚ as in the ‘red gold' of our ·
English ballads. In later Latin siclvus occurs as a slang term for
gold coin (like our‘yellow boy ’). ⁴

vertatur: jussive subjunctive, in semi-dependence on effice.
¹04· optatis: substantival,12n.
munere solvit. The expression is on the analogy of solvere
pecuniam, &c Bacchus duly pays the reward for service rendered
-the restoration of his strayed reveller‚ 101. But the same phrase
is used in 135, in reference to this same munus, with exactly the
finitent “fill‘tlltllsttllthiathaldi?
the word closely with nocitura: ‘bewailed the harm the gif’t would
do, and was vexed that,' &e D.A.S.]
105. Liber: see Vocabulary.
petisset: virtual oratio obliqua, representing the god’s thought.
106. malo, ‘the fatal gift.¹
Bemoynrme heroa. Like the Greek ἥρως, leros corresponds
to our ‘hero’ only in its special signification of ⁶ demigod ’. Midas
had a divine parent in the person of the goddess Cybele‚who was
worshipped on the Phrygian mountain Berecyntus,16n. So ‘Tiryn-
thius heros'= Hercules, ‘Calydonius heros’=Meleager, and cf. 773.

107. ‘He puts the fulfilment of the promise to the test by touching
this and that! polliciti: probably neuter, used substantivalty.
fides may be either belief, faith in a thing, or that which justifies
such belief-a promise and its bona fides, or faithful performance.

108. eibi: ie. his powers.

Observe the characteristic variation of expression in this descrip-
tion of the king's alchemy, 108—26. Ovidis in his way as insatiable

. as Midas, ‘aurea fingens omnia!

110. palluit, ‘grew instant pale! The perfect expresses the
suddenness of the transformation. The'colour of gold is described by
the Latin poets as ‘pale ', with strict propriety from theirown point
of view, since the paleness of a swarthy Southern complexion is
sallow or yellow. Cf. 145, 417, and also Cat. Peleus and Thetis,
100 (of Ariadne) ‘Quam tum saepe magis fulvore expalluit auri!

111. oontaotu potenti, ‘ his magic touch.’ Potens, ‘compelling,’
‘prevailing', is regularly used of magic or mysterious power, and is
a stoclr epithet of Hecate, goddess of witchcraft. Cf. 308 ‘ tactu . . .
