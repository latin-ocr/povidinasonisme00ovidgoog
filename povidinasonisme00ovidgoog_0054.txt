72. tamt: practioelly=hausit, ‘drew down, ruoted.' The
MSS. reading in quantum is un-Latin and unintelligible. I have
printed in the text Housman's conjecture ‘via quarn tum ⁸. [Merkel
marks 71—84‘as an interpolation, and certainly (1) in quantum,
(2) harum in 76 (ἲ artum, an adverbial acc. = ‘closely ’), and (3)
vv. 83-4 are so questionable that he may be right in excluding
the passage. Das]

Milton, Samson Agunistes, ‘No time is this tu weep ur knocffihe
breast.’ Occasionally other parts of the body are specified-
the head, or the thigh 81. The passive is often used reflexively,
‘sinite oneself,’ i.e. ‘muurn'

trepidans, ‘ssuttering.’
¹ 78. exsttltantem: curative, ‘ struggling to leap away, shake itself
uose.'

81. cunata. lnstances ol such ‘frustration ul effurt' occur fre·
quently in the poem, and are well calculated to display the poet’s
ingenuity in descrihing and varying the details uf the transforma·
tiuns. See Simmuns’ note on xiii. 569. Milton has imitated Met. iv.
586 in the scene in Paradise Lort (x. 504) where Satan, on returning
from his quest, receives frum the fallen angels, not the expected
acclamation, but ‘a dismal, universal hiss ', the assembled multitude
being tmnsiurmed into serpents.

82. fiunt: plural by attractiun into the number us robora.

84 pute· and fallare. Three points deserve notice here: (ι) the
‘potential' subjunctive. This is preferable tu explaining it as part
ol a conditional sentence, with a suppressed protasis—‘ il you were
tu see them ’. (a) Both the imperfect and the present tenses ol the
subjunctive are used ‘potentially'. The latter is more vivid—a
sort uf ‘historic ’ present. (3) Ohserve the ‘ideal’ second person,
i. e. the ‘you' is imaginary aud = ‘one’.
