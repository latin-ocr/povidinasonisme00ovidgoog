was lest unhampered to take at the tiood the tide which was to bear
him to mastery ol the Roman world. Vergil, Livy,Sallust and Horace
had grown to adolescence before the reign ol Augustus. Ovid’s career
falls exactly within the epoch of personal rule, and he stands alone
as a contemporary interpreter ol the latter hall ol the Augustan
period. lle was born too late to be touched by the bitter personal
memories ol the Civil ll'ars, which leil an enduring impress on the
minds ol men so different as the wistful and meditative Vergil, the
genial Horace, and the melancholic and effeminate Propertius.

v N or was man ever less stirred by that ‘divine discontent’ with the
ι’ present and actual, by which the poet is so osten moved to regret
(ἶ lor the past or, it may be, to aspiration lor the future. Ovid‚ on
'y the contrary, knows himself lor n true child ol his day:

‘Prisca iuvent alios: ego me nunc denique natum
gratulor; haec aetas moribus apta meis.'¹

He was to have good cause to revise this judgement. For thirty
years the reign os Augustus meant for him a tranquillity unruffled
by civil strile, congenial alilre to the man ol letters and the volup·
tuary; he was iated to have a bitter experience ol the other side ol

despotism—its unrestrained power t'or evil over the sonunes ol its
subjects.

Ovid, indeed, has a unique significance in regard to his genera·
tion. As Boissier well observes, in decided contrast with those ol his
contemporaries who, like Vergil and Livy, had sought their ideal in
the great pastor Roman history and legend, he rs entirely a modern.
i lt rs not merely that he believes' m his own time as the real‘ Golden

Age, as he says in jest: he insists on regarding antiquity through

’ξ its medium Even at the opening of lus national poem, the Fasti

he cannot deny himself a thmst at the antiquarians ol his day,
who must have lrowned on his profane handling oi the heroic
myths. ‘ We praise the worthies ol old-time-but we makethe best
oi our lit'e ol to·day.’² And in his portrayal oi the heroic age his
point ol view is the same. llis heroes and heroines in the Heroides,
his gods and goddesses in the Metamorphoses, are alilre, under no
impenetrable disguise, the elegant gentlemen and the lrail ladies ol
the court of Augustus
