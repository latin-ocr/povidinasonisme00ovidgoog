ΜΕΤΑΜΟΚΡΗΟΞΕΞΙ XI. 343-361

Caes. B. G. i. 2 ‘pro multitudine hominum . . . angustos se fines
habere arbitrantur ².

345. dolens . . . dolendi. Repetition of this kind isa favourite
device of the poet, and is especially common with achange ol voice,
‘deceptus decipit ', &c Cf. 442, 3.

[346-409. Snch the heng's tale. When lo! there flies to them the
herdsman whom Peleus hanl lest te tend his cattle. Brenthless, he
relates that a mnrdemus wolf is hanying the hine on the share.
‘T o armsJ’ But Peleus, conscience-stn‘cken, sees in the welf an
ambiesgagy of ss‘ihSlel'mfth‘rffl‘ to avengekher murgezcli sen, “mh
hhe ravhhhh, he chhhhelhhssly Zsszaygshrv‘lffggyeffflewill thehghhzhlhy
the Nereida wrath’ But hes petilian Jhlls on deas ears.- n is lest
for Thetis to intercede and procura pardon sor her husband. But
the wolf, new grown iman'able, stays not his slaughter at the
Nerein's command, and is turned into the ‘WolsStone ⁹. Peleus
makes his may te Magnesia, and there atlantis absolvedfrem his
blaodgm'ltiness by K ing Acastus]

This episode is derived from Nicander. See Introduction xiii.

3 50. feret: subj. because in orat. obl. alter edere.

351. trepidi orie. Genitive oi description with T rechinins (sc.
heros or rex). The line aptly marks the kindly solicitude ol the
monarch for his guest.

352. This speech ol the herdsman shows little ol Ovid’s undoubted
dramatic power. lt is too prolix and bombastic to befit a speaker
of humble rank (and scant of breath, 347), and the descriptione
which it contains, however elegant, are quite inappropriate at
a time when ‘delay is ruinous'‚ 376.

353. medio orbe: poetical abl. of ‘place where' without pre·

ositrou.
p 354. videret: ‘subj. byassimilation’ to that of the sentence on
which it depende, ‘ cum . . . respiceret'.

The meaning is that the distance already traversed, on which the
Sun looks back, is as great as that which still lies before him,
i.e. he has completed the half of his career. We are thus told
three times (cf. medio orbe and altissimus in the previous line) that
it was neon-day. See Introd. xvi.

359. templa: 8n.

subsunt, ‘lies hard by.’ Some of the older commentators
thithsttlilt lli}th‘ttithl'tltiitsh‘ttulit
f f
expressed it differently.

360. trabibus, ‘tree-trunks,’ as often, 642.

361. Nereides: cf. 380. The wolf is the chosen instrument of
Psamathe’s wengeance‚ 267 n, and naturally makes his lair in the
vicinity oi her temple.
