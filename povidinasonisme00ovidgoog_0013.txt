viii INTRODUCTION

his writiogs was only the official reason lor his exile, sor the Ars
Amatoria had been published ten years before, and Ovid, now in
the maturity ol his powers, had gone sar to retrieve his reputation,
as a man, by a more enduring marriage and the cultivation os more
influential and reputable friends, and as aserious poet by the larger
scope ol his national poems the Metamorphoses and Fasti. lle may

even have hoped to succeed to the position which Vergil and Horace
had held with the emperor, as he had succeeded to their reputation
with the public.

lt is useless to attempt to ascertain the real reason lor this
crushing sentence. Ovid is afraid to permit himself any too explicit
reference to it. He protests that his offence was a blanden nota
crime‚¹ and that he is punished because his ‘eyes unwittlngly
beheld a scandal’.² Did he stumble on some dark court secret
which was dangerous or discreditable ¹to Augustus himself? The

lact that he was banished, and not silenced once for all by the
executioner or the assassin, seems to exclude any such supposition.

The most probable theory is that he had been a consenting witness
or a confidant in some offence committed by a member ol the
imperial family. lt is impossible, at any rate, not to remark the
coincidence in the date os the poet's banishment and the disgrace
ol the younger Julia. lt may be that he had been privy to her
intrigue with Silanus.³ ¹

Like Cicero, he sailed to support his exile with manly endurance;
and he unsolds the somewhat tnonotonous ⁴ pageant oi his bleeding
heart’ with a lach os restraint which even a sympathetic reader is
apt to find jarring. But in palliation ol his weakness we must
allow lor the completeness ol the transformation in his fortunes.
Ovid was a town-bred wit, unwarlike, somewhat effeminate, with all
his thoughts and interests engaged in the lile of the gay and polished
circles os the pleasure-loving capital; he was transplanted to a
serni-barbarous town on the confines ol the empire. There every-
thing tras bleak, cheerless‚ inhuman-the complete lack ol congenial
society; the rigorous winters with their interminable snows; the
long-haired Sarmatians careering wildly through the streets; the
