METAMORPHOSES XI. 617-644

in the management of his elaborate detail

620. metm: 811.

621. excussit sibi se, ‘shook himself oli? Ovid cannot resist

the hapless Erysichthon) ‘seque viro inspirat ’.

622. quid, ‘why’

movit: here = agnozv't, ‘ heknew the goddess'

623. Somne: repeated for emphasis. Compare the more im·

‘Methought l heard a voice cry “ Sleep no morel
Macheth does murder sleep”‚ the innocent sleep,
Sleep that lmits up the ravell'd sleave os care?

This is a common form os expression in the epic poets,
starting with Homer, by which one name is supposed tube given to
the same person or thmg hythe gods, another by mankind. The
most probable explanation ofthis curious literary conventionis that
the so·called ‘ divine' names were merely older names, which had
been superseded by newer coinages. People were unable to under·
stand the meaning and derivation os some of these archaic forms,
and accounted for their existence by attributing them to divine
invention.

642. Phantasos: see Vocabulary.

644. hl: lcelos and Phantasos.
