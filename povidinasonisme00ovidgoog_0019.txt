ln Book Xlll the suicide of Ajax is not followedby his transforma·
tion: a flower blossoms from his blood, 00 which his name is
graves-the lryacinth.¹

ln this way Ovid contrives to present what he calls a perpetuum
carmen-a continuous history 01 the world from the original chaos
to the last transformation, that 01 the murdered Caesar into a star.
Through his pages move the gods and goddesses 01 heaven, hell,

and the sea,¹ the furies, nymphs, dryads, satyrs, and the heroes
and demigods 01 legend from Deucalion to Numa. The work takes

all ancient mythology for its province, and contains the rnost
brilliant and diversihed pictures of man's emoriens, whether grave
or gay, fierce or render, of his manifold activities, and 01 the
scenery of nature in all her moods.

Ovid commands all the antiquarian lore suitable to his design,
but he moves so lightly beneath the load which had oppressed some
of his forerunners that it is easy to underestimate the extent of his
erudition.² And, on the other hand, his originality has often been
called in qu'estion by his critics. Dryden, whose judgement in this
case is as much to seek as his grammar, says 01 Chaucer and Ovid,
⁴ neither were 01001100001000.η Now, our imperfect knowledge of
the ancient myths makes it impossible 10 pronounce with certainty
on the originality of particular episodes, and such stories as those
of Philemon and Baucis and 01 Pyramus and Thisbe⁴ (which are
mentioned by 00 other ancient author) are ascribed to Ovid’s
invention only by more or less plausible conjecture. But it may at
least be said for him, that where we are able to compare his
version ofa story with those 01 his predecessors‚ it reveals in most

¹ Cf. also viii. 230, where icarus ouly gives ln's nerva 10 the sea in which
he is drowned; or perhaps, according to the explanation 01 Mr. W. C.
Summers, Ovid here ‘may have reckoned the mere assumption 01 wings as
a metamorphosis ’.

² lt is rarely that this eleverest 01 the Alexandrian school sels himself to
exhibit his large reading. 'l'wo references may suffice. Medea, flying over
Greece‚ sees beneath her many sites famed for the transformations which
had happened there. ln these fifty lines (vii. 350-400) the poet alludes to
00 fewer than nineteen legends, none 01 which is elaborated. So iu iv. ²7⁶
Alcithoe, one of the improus Minyeides, when called on for a tale, before
finally choosing to tell the story 01 Salmacis, mentions half a dozen others
