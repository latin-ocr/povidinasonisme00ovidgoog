METAMORPHOSES XI. 272-285

‘si quis mihi parvulus aula
luderet Aeneas, qui te tamen ore referret,
non equidem omnino capta ac deserta viderer.’

273. tranem ademptum: 6811.

275. The three verbs venr't, intravit, and reliquit, following
postquam, go to make up the protasis of the long sentence ‘quo
postquam . . . memorat '. ln the apodosis memorat is the principal
verb, and ‘copia cum facta est’ is subordinated to it.

276—7. Construe: ‘reliquitque sub opaca valle haud procul a
muris greges pecorum (quos secum trahebat) (et) armenta, quae
secum trahebat! “

2ἷ6. trahebat: appropriately of the slow trailing gait of the
catt e.

277. nub, ‘down in ’, a pregnant use of the preposition.

279. velamenta, lt was the custom for suppliants to bear wands
or olive branches tipped with woollen tillem... Cf. Spph. 0.·R.3
mhts‘lllttl titilltltnlfflnl‘hlt oiiiugin‘i3f“¹¹¹¹¹¹⁵

qut. Observe the distinction between the adjective qui and
die substantival quei. qui implies a description ‘what manner
oman’. .

282. luvet: jussive suannctive, in semi-dependente on petit
103 n. Itis incorrect to explain this common construction by
supposing an omission of ut3 iuvetis in its origin an independent
jussive‚ and is thus only partially subordinated to petit. R. 1606.

eontra: adverb.

283. mediae quoque plebi, ‘even to the humbler sort' (much
more to you); media plebs, a common expression in Ovid for the
‘middle classes ³, &e

284. neo: 201. The emphasis falls on inhospita—‘no churlish
realm is this we own ’. We may compare the sentiments expressed
bg Dido in her welcome to Aeneas and his fellonem, Verg. Aemi.

⁵ zgssquhe commentators have discovered needless difficulty in
this line. Ceyx says that such favours as Peleus craves-a dwelling
in Trachin or its countryside—are freely granted even to the
humbler of his subjecte. But besides his own readiness to accede
to the request (⁶ huic animo’ = ‘ this feeling of mine towards you ⁹),
the suppltant is able to urge decisive claims (nimenta) in the shape
of his renown and divine lineage. momentum (mov-mentum-the
metaphoris from a balance), like the corresponding ῥοπή in Greek,
has always the notion of a dect'sive motive, cause, or event. So
Lucan's famous line, ‘Momentumque luit mutatus Curio rerum' =
Curio’s defection tumred tlte scale in the struggle (between Caesar
and the Senate), Cf. Ovid, Epist. ex Ponto, iv. 13. 49 ‘quanta potes
praebe nostrae momenta saluti '.
