17. tympana, ‘kettledrum’, the mystic instrument of Cybele.
It had been introduced into the festivals of Bacchus, with the ritual
of which the Pbrygian cult had much in common. Exciting music
of this kind bas played a large part in orgiastic religions, both
ancient and modern.

Bauohei ultilatus. Two points are to be noticed here: (1) the
hiatus in the fifth foot, cf. 933 (2) the ending with a word of four
syllables, cf. 456. Both peculiarities are imitations of Greek
prosody and are in Latin especially found with Greek words. Cf.
Verg. Ecl. ii. 24 ‘in Actaeo Aracyntho ’.

19. non exauditi: with causal force.

20. attonitas, ‘spellbound’ attonitus, lit. ‘thunderstruck', is
used figuratively of the stupefaction caused by not only sur-
prise, but sear, joy, sorrow, or any strong emotion3 ‘astonish’

is often found in older English with this general signification.
Milton, P. L. i. 316:

‘lf such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal spirits!

See Trench, Select Glossary qs English Words, used primarily
in senses differentfrom their present.

22. orphei titulum . . . theatri-in apposition to v. 21, ‘the
glorious audience of Orpheus! For titulus and theatrum see
Vocabulary. triumphi is also read and would go very well with
titulus. But the best MSS. 'give theatri, though it is awkward to
have theatro in 2 5 following so closely. Such repetitions occur not
infrequently in the Metamorphoses, which never received Ovid's
final revision. See his ‘ envoi ⁹, p. xx.

Orphei: adjective.

23. cruentatis: they tore the animals to pieces. So divulsere,
38, and cf. Eur. Bacchae, 739. Such scenes of animals cruelly dis-
membered and eaten raw were characteristic of the Bacchic orgus,
and from them the god was called Dionysus Omophagus-eater of
raw flesh. Swinburne, ‘bloodfeasts of tbe Bassarids.'

24. lune: abl. of time

25. noeti· avem : the owl.

structo utrimque theatro. A poetical equivalent for ‘ amphi-
theatre’. The shows there began early (rnatutz'na) with figbts
between rnen and beasts (called venationes); the gladiatorial
spectacles carne later in the day.

theatro and harena (26) are poetical ablatives of place without
prgg: eeu. The apodosis of the simile begins at vadernque, 27.
