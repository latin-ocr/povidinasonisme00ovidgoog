xii INTRODUCTlON

lll. THE llETAMORPHOSES

ln the Third Georgr'c, Vergil, opening with an invocation of Pales
and Apollo, the shepherd gods, justifies his enoioe of theme with
tlre assertion that the fables of the Greek mythology were in his
day trite and outwom. The Cyclic poets, Pindar, the Greek
tragedians, the Alexandrines, and Vergil'sown Roman predecessors
-all these had traversed the ground after Homer, and we need not
doubt that the poets of the time were beginning to feel that this
stringintheir lyre was growing sadlyfrayed. But the veryantiquity
of such a heritage of myth, attesting as it does its possession of
permanent springs of human interest, becomes a challenge to the
innovator, and encourages a great poet to make it the medium for
the expression of his own outlook upon life; so our own Victoriae
poets experienced in succesion the fascination of the Arthurian
cycle. ln like manner Ovid, gifted with the fresh sensibility and
the exuberant creative power of the Italian race, set himself to
rejuvenate this heroic mythology; animated with the new life he
imparted to it, it passed into the Middle Ages to furnish the poets
and painters of that time with their linest subjects and studies.

The Metamorphoses, though a narrative and heroic,is not, strictly
speaking, an epic poem. Ovid, indeed, sustains the ‘ epic illusion¹
by the employment of the stock devices—an occasional catalogue
of names or invocation of the mnses, and the characteristic epic
diction with its ligures and tropes. But some of this is ironical and
mock heroic ; and the scanty and perfunctory exordium with which
the poem opens (if it be not a trace of its unrevised condition) is
perhaps a proof that Ovid did not take himself too seriously as an
epic poet.

The artistic unity of the poem consists not in singleness of con·
ception, but in the formal ingenuity of arrangement and transition
by which the legends are linked one to another. ln the epics of
fonner Roman poets, the great destiny of the Imperial City·-the
ozor'estos Romae-had been the underlying principle of unity; even
the annalistic epic of Ennius, penetrated with this central idea, lost
something of its fonnlessness. ln the Metamorphoses, on the other
hand, the Roman legends which appropriately round off the work
are not organic to it; and the doctrines of metamorphosis and
