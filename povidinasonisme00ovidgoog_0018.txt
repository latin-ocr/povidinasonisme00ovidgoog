THE METAMORPHOSES xiii

metempsychosis, which Pythagoras expuunds in Book XIV, though
they fumish the poem with a kind ol philosophical basis, nevertheless
strike the reader as being something of an afterthought. .

lt is this lack os avital unisyingconception, rather than the slight
nature ol the theme, which distinguishes the Metamorphoses from
a poem like the aeneid. We need not inquire minutely how lar
Ovid was indebted sorbis subject to his predecessore. Trans·
sonnations occur in Greek literature as early as Homer,-Hesiod,
and Simonides, and the subject was a favourite-one with the
Alexandrian school. Ovid certainly owed something to the later
Greek writer Nicander,¹ possibly also to Parthenius.² But his
claim to originality of treatment lies in his perception that a mere
concatenation ol legends, involving the conception of the gods as
supernatural powers capriciously exercising their power lor human
weal or woe, besides having only a remote interest lor his own
, rationalist day, was altogether too slight and too monotonous
a subject toran elaborate poem. He dexterously cast his net much
wider, so asto incorporate in his work no small partos the heroic
legends. The actual transformations olten serve merely as a lormal
justification ol the brilliant episodes which hang by them and

vindicate the subject from the triviality which might otherwise ·

have been charged against it. One oi the linest passages ol the
poem is the description in Book ll ol the Sun-god’s palace, and
the fatal cbarioteering of the hapless Phaethon. Yet it is not
Phaethon that is transformed, but his half-brother Cycnus and the
Heliades, his weeping sisters. ln Book Vlll the transformation of
Meleager's sisters into guinea-lowl is told in two lines, but these
serve to give the required conclusion to the long story of the hunt-

ing ol the Calydonian boar, and of Meleagers extinction. Moreover, Ι

the poet gives the widest interpretation to the term ‘metamorphosis’.

¹ Nicander oi Colophon (ster. c. 150 Β. e.) wrote, inter alia, a work on
Metamorphoses called Ἑτεροιούμενα, os which only alew words remain. We
know something ol its contenta from Antoninus Liberalis (flor. c. 150 Α. m),
who summarized it.

¹ Parthenius of Nicaea opened a school of poetry in Rome about 54 Β. e.
He wrote assoem called Metamorphoses. We baveno evidence that Ovid
drew upon t is work, but in view of Parthenius’s rominent position in
Roman literary circles (he taught Vergil Greek) ari Ovid's ready appre-
cietion (and assimilation) ol the poetical talent of his day, the inserence
seems highly probable.
