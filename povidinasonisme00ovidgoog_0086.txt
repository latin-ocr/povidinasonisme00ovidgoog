651-2. urbem Haemoniam: Trachin, 409 0.

65411110 vestibus ullis: the garments 011110 Greeks hung
100ἰο17 00 the person, and so were easily disengaged or washed off
rnt ewater.

656. capulis: for the simple abl. cf. 117.

657. refuso. The precise force of the prep. in this compound, as
used here, is not very obvious. Page’s explanation seems hardly
satisfactory, when in his note 011 usumin (at Verg. Aen: i. 126),
‘used of·a liquid which flows up instead of down,' he cites this
passage, translating ‘ tears upwelling o'er his face ’. Other MSS.
give prensare, for which cf. 418.

‘certe violata potestas
invenit ista deos,'

where thes eaker Metellus is referring to the ‘tribunicia potestas ’,
andista= aecnostra. D.A.S.] So here haec and ista both refer
10 the same thing, ‘this news,’ but ista has the special shade 01
meaning ‘the news 1 have told you’. 011101. Epp. i. 6. 67 ‘si
quid novisti rectius istis, candidus imperti 1 si non, hisutere mecum ', ·
where Wilkins translates ‘what is now before you ’. Μ. 486. [The
change 110111 haec 10 ista is odd, and the ablative rumoribus difficult.
Ovid may havewritten ‘ non mista vagis rumoribus '—-the story is
not wrapped up in a cloud of questionable detail. Cf. xii. 541

‘mixtaque cum veris passim commenta va antur
milia rumorum! -D. A. ΒΞ ·
