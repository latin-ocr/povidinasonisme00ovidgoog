OVlD ΑΝΙ) THu AUGUSTAN AGE xi

ln his earlier works, the Amores and Ars Amatoria, the poet
holds up, without pretence ol shame, a faithful mirror to the gilded
society in which he moved. Of that circle he was an honoured
and distinguished member, und in applauding him it applauded
itsell. Religion and morality, as he cynically shows us, had been
reduced by his world, theone to mere formalism,¹ the otberto
a sraction oi a moral code,² which barely suffices to hold society
together at all. Seriousnessand austerity are virtues which such an y
age finds intolerable‚ and dismissesas ‘rusticity ’. lt declines to be
bored with serious interests even in its poetry‚ and its poets cannot
become suspect of moral earnestness and artistic sincerity without
sadly compromising theirreputationlor ‘urbanity' with the elegant
tribbles oi their world.

lt was inevitable that such an enviromnent should react on the
genius os the poet. And unfortunately there came into vogue at
this time a system which te'nded to make poetry respond still more
readily to popular laste—the custom ol recitatio, or the reading by
a poet os his works to the public.³ lt was idle to expect in society
audiences the serious interest and power of concentration essential
to the appreciation os elaborate compositions3 the result was that
the poet wrote for them what they wished to hear, and contented
himself with a slipshod ac'complishment of those parts ol his poem
which did not lend themselves to rhetorical effect. lt is unnecessary
to show in detail how this led to the characteristic delects ol later
Latin poetry-lack ot organic unity‚ the elaboration of the parts at
the expense ot the whole, excess ot detail in descriptions, straining
atter effect, above all, strong rhetorical colouring. Ol all these
tendencies Ovid betrays the symptoms. We can hardly be mistaken‘
in attributing them in part to his rhetorical training, but most of all
to this custom ol recitatio, which only confirmed those faults in
poetical compositions which in theory it should have done much to
amend and eradicate.

² ‘Reddite depositum ; pietas sun foedera servet; Fraus absit3 vacuas
caedis habete manus,’ A. A. i. 641-2.

³ ovid tells us (Trist. iv. 10. 57) that he read his tarracina iuvenalia
to public attdiences, aad the theorp that the ltlctaatotpttosas was intended
tor similar reading is extremely pro able.
