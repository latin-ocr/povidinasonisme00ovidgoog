ttut tue poet has the delects ol his qualities. He lacked ‘ the last
ettd greatest art— the art to blot ’. When he likes, he can phrase
uu epigram with the finished conciseness of a Juvenal, but only too
ouen his lucility and lack os restraint led him into tasteless ‘ conceits'
euti wittlcisms, and into tautology and redundance ol expression.
aa Quintilian says ol him,¹ he is ¹ too londos his own cleverness ’. A
good instance ol this repetition is i. 89-93, where he expresses in
eiu several ways the idea that in the Golden Age there was no need ,
ul the coerclon os law.² Such enlargements on a text occur most
commonly, by reason of the theme and the mette, in the Heroides,
but there are many instances in the llletazrrrorpkoses‚ notably in the
speeches. Yet they are lor the most part executed with such
clevemess, and (oltenl with such telling rhetorical effect, that
though instructive and amusing, it is not altogether just to reduce
Ovid's exuberance to a cold summary in prose, as Dr. Postgate³

has done lor a few lines ol Heroides xiv, lor the purpose ol reveal·
ing the meagreness (a'nd sometimes inanity) ol the thought which

it expresses or conceals.

There remains the other lault already noted—lack ol taste and
propriety in the use ol wit and ‘conceit'.⁴ This is especially ap·
parent in some ol Ovid’s Persohifications, and distigures what
would otherwise be the most successful descriptions ol this kind in
Latin poetry.⁶ And instances ol a more general character might be
multiplled indefinitely. At 701 (where see note) the readiness of

¹ ‘Nimium amatorvingenii sul,' rt. 1. 88.

¹ For an instance in this book see 35 3-4.

⁸ Introd. to Propertius, Select Elegies. ‘lt is as a rhetoriclan that Ouid
excels. He arranges his matter, he divides it into its parts. He compares it
with what it does not resemble. and distinguishes it from what it could not
be mistaken lor, elucidating it all the while by a generous display ol
antithesis and other rhetorical devices ol repnte?

⁴ Due allowance must be made lor the variation of taste in this regard
from one age to another. Even Milton condescende to plays upon words
(or paronomasia, as his editors would eall them—P. L. v, 808 :

to begirt the Almighty throne,
Beseeching or besieging.
