xviii INTRODUCTION

Verse translations ol Ovid have been lew and far between in
recent years. A specimen is appended ol the gracelul and
scholarly translation ol the Metamorphoses in blank verse by
Henry King. The passage selected is the lamous description ol

the Cave ol Sleep‚ xi. 592-615 :-

‘Fast by Cimmeria's bounds the torpid home
Ol Somnus stands: a cavernous hollow scooped
. Deep in a mountain-side, where never ray

Ol morn or noon or eve, with cheerful gleam
Oi sunlight finds an entrance :—mist and sog
From the dank soil upsteaming load the air,
And all the spot a doubtful twilight shrouds. , -
Never the crested bird os morn awakes
Aurora lrom her couch :—no watchdog there,—
Or goose, more wakeful than the watchdog's sels, ⁸
The silence breaks :—no beast, or wild or tame, ’
Νο wind-stirred forest-braum, no interchange ·
Oi human speech the dumb dead quietrmars
Unbroken save where from the mountain's base
A rivulet of Lethaean virtue purls
With tinkly murmur o’er a pebbly bed,
Inviting more to sleep. The threshold glowed
With scarlet wealth of poppies, and all herbs

-ἰ 01 sap to brew the slumberous charms that Night
Extracting, sprinkles'o’er the day-wom world.
No door in all the house to vex the ear
With creaking hinge z-no guard. no look, no bar
T o entrance. ln the cavern’s midst reposed '
On lolty couch oi ebon, piled with down
Of black accordant plumage‚ sable·draped‚
His limbs relaxed in slumber‚ lay the God.
Phantastic in a thousand mimic forms,
Countless as ears in harvest-time, or leaves
ln summer-woods‚ or sands on ocean’s shore,
Amund him couched his subject host ol Dreams.'
