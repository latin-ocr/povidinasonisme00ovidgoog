THE hlETAthRPHOSES xvii

editors to read for the hardly delensible MSS. reading ‘sine me

te', not ‘sine te me', as suggested by Lenz, but ‘sineme me ¹, the .

bolder correction of Heinsius, may serve to give us a measure of
the poet's reputation for tas'te. Ovid indeed has no compunction
in making his characters the mouthpieces of his verbal ingenuities,
and that on the most unsuitable occasions. On this score he fully
merits the censure which Dryden bestows upon-him: ‘On these
occasions the poet should endeavour to raise pity, but instead of
that Ovid is tickling you withalaughss‘ ἵ ’

lf we estimare Ovid’s poetry by Milton's threefold canon—-
simplicity, sensuousness, and passion, we shall find, perhaps, that
only in respect of the second of these qualities does he take the
highest rank. His simplicity is that of a poet of a retined age,
working under the time-honoured forms of his craft ; it is no more

than an artificial and elaborated counterfeit of the real quality.
And Ovid's surroundings were not favourable to the development

ol strong feeling and real passion. But though these qualities are
lacking in him, he is indeed one of those ‘for whom the visible
world exists’. ln fresh and vivid sensibility to form and colour
and its expression by a rich and vigorous imagination, he stands

supreme ς nor does this excellence exclude another, which seems at
first sight hardly compatible with itssa keen psychological insight
into the affections and emotions of mankind.

But while all such ready-made tests of poetry are of necessity
mechanical and unsatisfactory, Milton's canon, as applied to Ovid,
is especially arbitrary and exclusive. We shall arrive at a juster
estimate of our poet if we judge him by the broader and simplet
standards of the classical critics of his own time, and say of Ovid,
as he said of Callimachus‚¹

‘semper toto cantabitur orbe: ·
quamvis ingenio non valet, arte valet!

Though we may credit him with only a moderate portion oi
ingenium, ‘the vision and the faculty divine,’ yet in virtue of his
consummate ars- the correspondence of language to thought,
grace and directness of expression, unfailing originality and
variety of treatment, many will follow Niebuhr in considering him
as, after Catullus, by far the most poetical of the Roman poets.
