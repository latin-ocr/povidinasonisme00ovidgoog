In the Tenth book Ovid tells how Orpheus, the Thracian bard,
bereaved oi his wise Eurydice, descended into the underworld to
beg sor her restoration. There his minstrelsy so prevailed with the
infernal powers that they consented to restore her on condition
that, in leading her away, he sorbore to look back until they had
fully reached the upper air. This pledge he kept until they attained
the surtlrest borders os hell, but then ‘he paused and gazed back
on his own Eurydice, unmindsul, alas! and vanquished in resolve.
ln that moment all his toil was lost: inan instant she vanished sar
away, like smoke that mingles with the unsubstantial air’ (Verg.
Georg. iv. 490). ln despair at his loss, he shunned the company oi
mankind, disdaining the Thracian women who would sain have been ·
his consolers. Wandering over the rnountains he led in his train
wild beasts, rivers, rocks, and sorests, enchanted by the music of
his lyre.
