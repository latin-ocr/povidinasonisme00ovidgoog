PREFACE

Tua text which I have adopted in this edition is less
conservative than that of Merkel, on which it is mainly
based. Ι have occasionally followed the recension by
Mr. G. M. Edwards in the Corpus Poetarum Lotrhomm
edited by Dr. Postgate. Sixty lines have been excluded
as unsuitable for school reading.

For the Notcs, I have derived some help from the
school edition of Siebelis (revised by Polie), and have
read, besides, Lemaire (for Burmann and the older
commentators), Merkel, and Haupt. Of English com-
mentaries on Ouid, I gladly acknowledgc my obligations
to Professor Palmer’s Heroides, and to the editions of
Books XIII and 'XIV of the Metamorphoses by Mr. C.
Simmons, and of Book VIII by Mr. W. C. Summers

Professor D. A. Slater, of University College, Cardiff,
very kindly looked over the Notes and Introduction.
I have given some of his notes in brackets, with his
initials affixed; but these represent only a part of the
numerous criticisms, corrections and references of which
he has given me the advantage. To my colleague,
Mr. P. N. Ure, I also owe thanks for a number of useful
suggestions.
