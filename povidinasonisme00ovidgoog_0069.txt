METAMORPHOSES XI. 286-300

Ι2116. aprumque Iovem: (the lact thatl'Jupiter is your grand·
sire, 21.
teinpora: 8n.
287. haee : deictic, with a wave 01 th'e hand, ‘the land you see ’.
h pro parte: an adverbial phrase like pro rata, ‘in a (hall)
sare!
voeato: the ‘ future’ imperative ior emphasis.

288. qualiacumque: modest or depretiatory, as osten. The
idea is ‘this poor realm 01 mine ’. Cf. Verg.Aen. i. 78 ‘quodcumque
hoc regni '-‘ this kingdom, ii Ι may call it so ’.

utinam videres: imperfect subjunctive 01 2 vain or unrealized
wish. Bradley‚ § 152.

289 11012221,ι began to weep’

290. Peleusque: 36 n.
hrot. hano: deictic again-he points to the hawk hovering above
tem.

292. putetis: the correct prose construction with forsitan, which
is used adverbially with the indic. only in the poets and post-classical
writers

294. beten. All the MSS. read acer, and haveeline at 293: ‘vir
luit: et tanta est animi constantia tanturn’ (corrected ‘quantum ¹).
But the verse is leeble and its Latinitymore than questionable,
while the omission 01 any connexion between 292 and 294 is quite
in the manner 01 Ovid. 1120120111 but almost certain correction
01 acer is due to Bentley's penetration.

agg. {eniteret Lucifer. For the abl. 271 n.

2 . ee n.

297. mlhl9t⁷ the so-called dative ‘oi the agent' alter the perfect
passive. 11 is really a dative 01 interest, but the inserence is made
that the person interested is the agent. M. 2 50 a.

299. illiue virtus. An easy instance 01 the periphrasis, common
lrom Homer onward‚ by which the real subject 01 a sentence is
expressed asa genitive (ora possessive adjective) dependent on a
noun which describes its quality. Thus Homer’s βίη Ἡρακληείη --
the strong Hercules. Ci. Hor. Odes i. 3. 36 ‘perrupit Acheronta
Herculeus labor’; Juv. iv. 107 ‘Montani quo ue venter adest ’‚
humorously for ‘the corpulent Montanus'3 11111100, Ρ. L. vii. 35 ς
‘Where the might 01 Gabriel fought '.

300. Thisbaeas: aiter Homer, who speaks 01 ‘dove-haunted
Thisbe’ (Il. ii. 502). 'l’his is an instance 01 what is known as an
‘ornamental' or ‘literary’ epithet, i. e. an epithet used not so much
to specisy an object as to recall to the reader's mind the passages in
Greek poets where the same description occurs. This· tendency
was carried to excess by several Roman poets in imitation 01 the
practice 01 theirmodels‚ the erudite and pedanticAlexandrian school.
But even Vergil has many instances‚ eg. ‘Strymonian’ cranes,
‘ ldumaean ’ palm-trees, ‘Amyclaean' dogs, ⁴ Cretan ² quivers.
