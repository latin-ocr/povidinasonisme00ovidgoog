I. LIFE AND WORKS OF OVlD

PUBLIUS Ovlblus Naso wasborn at Sulmo (Sulmone), a small
hill-town of the Peligni, about ninety miles to the east of Rome, on
the aoth of March, 43 Β. c„ llis communicative sels-consciousness,
fostered by long years of dreary exile, which threw him back upon
his memories of the past, has· lumished us with copious details ol
his life and literary activity.¹ The poet was descended from an
ancient and wealthy family of equestrian rank, and thus belonged
to the nobility of the ltalian country towns. His father, ambitious
for the advancement of his two sons, destined them for a public
career by which they might rise to senatorial rank. Accordingly
Ovid and his brother Lucius, his elder by exactly a year, were sent
to the capital, in order that they might study and practise rhetoric,
an indispensable equipment lor Roman public life, under Arellius
Fuscus and Porcius Latro, the best teachers of the day. Publius
had no turn for advocacy2‚ and until his brother died at the early
age of twenty, his unprolitable versifying met with only remon-
strance and admonition from his practical father. But when he
became sole heir, and was no longer under the necessity of pursuing
a lucrative but irksome profession, he was allowed at last to give
free scope to his inclination for poetry. First, however, our poet
completed his education, after the manner of the young Roman¹

nobility, by a short sojoum at Athens, the university of the ancient
world and the home of art, belles-lettres, and philosophy. This
was followed by a Grand Tour, in the company of his friend and
fellow-poet Macer, through the Greek cities of Asia Minor and Sicily.

On his return to Rome, Ovid did not devote himself exclusively
to poetry. We find him, in strange incongruity with our conception

ίῑΙῚΙΤίζιῖί. iv. 10 is a concise autobiogrnphy which gives most of the facts
⁰ ”lgerieeca (Contrua. ii. ιο) describes his rhetorical exercises as ‘solutum
carnun'-unversified poetry.
